     <h1>Why AZP</h1>
           <p>You've probably asked yourself, "Why is there a giant azp... at the top of the page?" </p>
           <p>The quick and easy answer is it's the first three letter of my last name which is very difficult for some to pronounce. Azpiazu (Az-pee-az-oo) is a Basque name from my father's side of the family. I think the sudden jump from A to Z throws people for a loop.</p>
           <p>While working for TGI Friday's, I was one of many Ashleys working in the building. To make things more difficult, another bartender was also named Ashley A. To help differntiate between us, people called us by our last names. Because mine is hard for people to pronounce, many began to call me A-Z-P. The nickname just kind of stuck.</p>
           <p>Yet, while creating my brand identity and logo, I wanted the "azp..." to represent more than my last name abbreviated. I like to think that it's short for <strong>a</strong> <strong>z</strong>ealous <strong>p</strong>erson and the ellipsis symbolizes the long list of things I'm interested in.</p>
           <p>As mentioned on my <a href="where-i'm-going.html">Where I'm Going page</a>, I'm willing to work in a wide variety of fields as demonstrated by he ellipsis. I could be a zealous person working in the public relations industry or representing a winery.</p>
           <p>The possibilities are endless and it still remains to be seen where the ellipsis will lead me. All I know is that I'm ready and excited for whatever the future has in store for me.</p>
