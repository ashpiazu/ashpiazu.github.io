    <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p>From the logo on top of my page, you've already gathered that I consider myself to be an editor, writer and communicator, yet those three descriptions merely scratch the surface of who I am. </p>
           <p>I was born and raised in St. Augustine, Fla., with two wonderful parents Dinah and Alfi. I have two older brothers who loved to tease and torment me when we were kids. Today, we're extremely close and I couldn't imagine life without them.</p>
          <!--First picture-->

           </figure>
           <p>My mother is from Ireland and has eight brothers and sisters. As a result, I have a very large family all over the world, from here in the United States to Ireland and all the way to Germany.</p>

            <p>The next family function I'll be attending will be my cousin Stacey's wedding this summer in Ireland. As a graduation present to myself, my boyfriend Matt and I will take an extra week off work and travel to France before the wedding.</p>
          
           <p>Yes that's right, I <em>finally</em> graduate in May. I'm proud to say that not only will I be graduating with honors from UF, a top ten journalism school, but I'll also be debt free.</p>
           <p>It may have taken me longer than most to earn my degree, but I was determined to graduate on my own terms. I didn't want to bury myself in debt just to get an education. I've worked my way through school and paid for every penny by myself.</p>

           <p>I'm fortunate enough to have a job that pays well and is so fun it doesn't feel like work. As a bartender I've had the opportunities to meet interesting people and learn valuable life skills.</p>
           
           <p>Plus, while I was a bartender for TGI Friday's I got to compete in various bartender competitions. How great is it to have a job that encourages you to flip bottles and have fun?</p>

      
           <p>The past two years have taught me that I'm capable of achieving any goal I set my mind to. Working full time while being a full-time student isn't an easy task, but it was definitely worthwhile.</p>
           <p>My educational experience has always reminded me of the Robert Frost poem "The Road Not Taken." I chose to take the path less traveled, and that has made all the difference because it has made me who I am.</p>

           <p>When I'm not flipping bottles or finishing schoolwork, I'm usually content relaxing at home with my boyfriend Matt and dog Olive. Relaxing generally entails cooking a healthy meal, cuddling up and watching Netflix or playing board games with friends.</p>
