          <p> One of my first published articles for <a href="http://wuft.org/" rel=external title="WUFT News" target="blank">WUFT News,</a> the story focuses on municipal golf courses in North Central Florida. I contributed reporting for the information on the Palatka Golf Club and took the article photograph. I had a lot of fun working on this story. I had the opportunity to ride along with five golfers while they played nine holes. I learned a lot about hands-on reporting and golfing that day.</p>

         <p>This is by far the most extensive article I've ever reported and written. I filed public records requests to 12 counties in North Centra Florida to see if they were complying with a recent state law aimed at making animal shelter records more accessible to the public. Between filing requests, conducting interviews and visiting animal shelters, the article took me close to three weeks to complete. I believe the hard work paid off, I'm very proud of the finished product.</p>

          </figure>
            <p>Showcasing my gator pride, I designed a UF football T-shirt for a class assignment. We were tasked with keeping cost and adaptability in mind while designing our T-shirts. Frustated that many UF T-shirts only come in orange, blue or white, I chose to design a shirt that would look good printed on a variety of colors. I also photoshopped the design onto stock photographs of models wearing different color shirts to help show the possible color schemes.  </p>

         </figure>
         <p>I created the infographic, wrote the article and designed the magazine spread for a visual journalism project in Spring 2012. The main focus of the assignment was to create an infographic to help better explain a story. I chose to show the minimal difference between the original Makers Mark recipe and the controversial watered-down recipe. The original recipe was only slightly more potent by two standard drinks.
